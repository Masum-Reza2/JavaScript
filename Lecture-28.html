        //Access and modify individual elements of a web page.
        //Add, delete, or modify HTML elements dynamically.
        //Change styles and classes of elements.
        //Respond to user actions and events on the web page.
        //Manipulate and retrieve data from HTML forms.
        //Traverse the hierarchy of elements to find specific nodes

        //BOM > Browser Object Model - Represents additional objects provided by the browser alert() confirm() prompt()
        //Opening and closing browser windows or tabs.
        //Navigating to different URLs.
        //Manipulating the browser's history (back, forward, etc.).
        //Displaying alert dialogs, confirming user actions, and input prompts.
        //Timing and scheduling tasks with methods like setTimeout() and setInterval().
        //Accessing browser-related information like the screen dimensions, URL, and referring page.
